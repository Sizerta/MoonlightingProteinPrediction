# Identifying Moonlighting Proteins

This project focuses on identifying moonlighting proteins using TF-IDF, biological features, and the ESM2 model.

## 📋 Project Overview

Moonlighting proteins are proteins that perform multiple functions, often unrelated to each other. This project aims to identify such proteins using a combination of text-based and biological feature-based approaches, along with the state-of-the-art ESM2 language model for proteins.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Code/`: Contains all the source code for the project
- `Data/`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis

## 🚀 Key Features

1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) analysis of protein descriptions
2. Extraction and analysis of biological features
3. Implementation of the ESM2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling) model for protein sequence analysis
4. Combination of multiple approaches for improved moonlighting protein identification
